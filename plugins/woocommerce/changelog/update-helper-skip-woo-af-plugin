Adds condition to ensure WooCommerce is not listed as a Woo extension in the Helper list. Restores the `woocommerce_show_addons_page` filter as a means of controlling whether the addons page is added as a WooCommerce submenu item. Hides a temporary extra addons submenu item using a better method borrowed from Jetpack.
